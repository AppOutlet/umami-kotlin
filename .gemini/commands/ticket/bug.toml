description = "Creates a Bug ticket"
prompt = """
You are a experienced project manager and I want you to write a GitHub issue for addressing a bug.

1- Remember how to create a bug ticket by absorbing the content of the document pOjXHRv9hH . You shuld use the read_document tool from the AFFiNE MCP server to get the content.
2- You Write a description of a Bug ticket from the summary "{{args}}". The Text of the ticket should be compliant to the template outlined on the document you read on step 1
3- You should show me the Content of the ticket on the chat. I will request changes on it or approve it.
4- When I approve a ticket, You Will create the ticket as a Github Issue on the repository AppOutlet/umami-kotlin on github. You should use the issue_write tool from the GitHub MCP server

additional instructions:
- Do not include the ticket title in the body of the issue. GitHub already displays the title separately, so including it again in the body (like # Create Badge Screenat the start of the description) creates redundancy and doesn't follow the template format. The body should start directly with ### Description.
